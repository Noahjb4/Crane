# VR Crane Training Simulation

A Virtual Reality application created with Unity 2019.3.8f to simulate the movement of a crane and teach the users how to operate correctly.

### Introduction
A new crane user will utilize this simulation before operating a real crane. This immersive simulation will allow them to practice mechanics such as starting the engine, moving the crane, picking up an item, and transferring it to another location. The userâ€™s performance can be timed and used as a performance measure. Once the instructor sees that the user is comfortable and confident using this crane simulation, they can move to the next training stage which will involve a real crane.

### Features
 - User will be able to handle the crane by moving levers that control the movement of the crane and the crane boom.
 - The crane can pick up items through a magnet mechanism.
 - Timer feature for performance measure.

### Setup
 1. Open this project file using Unity 2019 or later
 2. Run the scene called CraneModelSample
